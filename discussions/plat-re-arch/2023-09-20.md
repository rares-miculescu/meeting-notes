### Agenda

Status updates

### Discussions

MP: I opened a follo-up PR ([1103](https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/pull/1103)). 

MP: Not much happened.

MP: I saw the `RTC` PR, you need to define `exportsyms` and headers. `RTC` should use platorm bus.

RD: There could be some issues with `linuxu`.

RD: Are apps that use `RTC`?

RD: I will give you some PRs to look at the testing.

MP: `RTC` is a small driver, Rares should spend some time to see how it works. I can provide some links.

MP: I will write some details as well for bus.

RD: I provided a PR where we discussed `RTC` in the past.

MP: We still need to move out things from plat.

SM: I forgot to do in `EFI` series. These are not discoverable and we need to discuss how we integrate it.

SK: Isn't it basically an `MMIO`?

SM: There are devices that are not `MMIO` mapped.

SM: Isn't platform bus integrated in `ukbus`?

SK: `ukbus` is an API library between all the buses.

SM: So we want to do like linux does at runtime.

SK: The bus is basically a database of what is where.

MP: We should continue this discussion at the gathering, where we meet in person.

### TODOs and Decisions

RM: Go through documentation recieved.

RM: Test `linuxu` on previous versions, to see if it works.

RM: Improve the `RTC` PR.
