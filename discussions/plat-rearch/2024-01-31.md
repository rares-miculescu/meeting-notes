### Agenda

Status updates

### Discussions

RM: I have tested and updated the rtc driver: [#972](https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/pull/972)

RM: I noticed that on the latest release, some apps do not work. I only tested on arm. I don't know if this happens on x86 as well.

MP: Share your screen to see the problem.

RM: I will clone the `app-sqlite` and run `setup.sh`. Following the instructions from the README and compile we get this error:

``` 
[    0.000000] CRIT: [libkvmplat] <setup.c @  234> Failed to get PSCI method: -2.
[    0.000000] CRIT: [libkvmplat] <cpu_native.c @   78> Couldn't shutdown system, HALT!
```

MP: This means that PSCI can't be fount in the device tree. Dump `qemu.dtb`, to see if we have PSCI there.

MP: We have it. Go to `setup.c` and see where it breaks.

MP: Go into menuconfig and set to show all debug messages.

RM: Now it works.

MP: Strange. Now set it back the wat it was.

RM: Now it fails.

MP: I will take a deeper look into this.
